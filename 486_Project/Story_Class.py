There are countless stories within this world, each with their own kind of ending whether it be good, bad, or somewhere in-between.
Out of those there is a kind of story about a chosen one who was destined to save the world or right some kind of wrong.
This however, isn't one of those stories. This story is yours. You're a nobody who decides to become a somebody and
make a name for yourself. The path to becoming a brave hero where you begin your journey and become a part of a tale as old
as time of good versus evil. In order to save this land you must overcome many trials and tribulations to
have the chance to defeat the dragon that plagues us, corrupting the land and it's inhabitants.
