* Fighting Game
  * I want to make a fighting game (probably 2D)
  * Probably when you have some free time you could load it up, probably targeting ages 12-40
  * web
  * 2
* Chatbot
  * I could try to make a chatbot that would tell you something new about yourself
  * Probably when you have some free time you could load it up, and doesn't really have a age range for the audience
  * web
  * 3
* Text Adventure
  * I want to create a game that is a text adventure that will focus on combat than the story
  * When someone wants to relax and has a fair amount of free time, probably targeting ages 12-40
  * web
  * 4-5
- My preferred idea would be making the text adventure. This idea feels like it can be challenging while also feeling like it wouldn't be too daunting or stressful and could be fun the more I work on it. I think I'll get a better idea what I want to do and possible complications when I delve into it.
