**Name: Will Pratt**  

# Overview #
* I will be creating a game that concept wise is inspired from old-school text based adventures. One frame of reference that I've been given was
MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) which allowed for various kinds of interaction like player and evironment, but my implementation will be single-player 
instead and less kind of world interactions like in MUD. There will be some NPC interaction but will be more oriented and focused on combat. 
After it's completed the world will be provided with another piece of entertainment.

# Concept #
* In Scope
  * There will be classes for the player to choose from
    * They should feel different by how they're played
    * They should have strengths and weaknesses
  * There will be skills designed around each class
  * There will be NPCs
    * The main amount of NPCs will be in the form of 
      hostile enemies that the player must defeat in
      order to progress
    * There will be a friendly NPC that will assist 
      the player at the end of each area excluding
      the final area
   * Menus for the player to use in-game
     * Skills
     * Items
  
* Out of Scope  
  * Incorporate sounds
    * These can be applied to the player or NPCs
  * Incorporate visuals
    * This wouldn't affect the core mechanics of 
      of the game but would be a lot to implement
      a UI for the user to interact with the game
      and for the game itself

# Requirements #
1. Must be able to alternate between player and enemy for turn-based combat
2.
