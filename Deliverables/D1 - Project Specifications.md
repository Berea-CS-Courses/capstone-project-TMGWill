**Name: Will Pratt**  

# Overview #
  * I will be creating a game that concept wise is inspired from old-school text based adventures. One frame of reference that I've been given was
  MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) which allowed for various kinds of player and evironment interaction , but my implementation will be single-player 
  instead of online and less kind of world interactions like in MUD. There will be some NPC interaction but will be more oriented and focused on combat. 
  After it's completed the world will be provided with another piece of entertainment.

# Concept #
  * In Scope
    * There will be classes for the player to choose from
      * They should feel different by how they're played
      * They should have strengths and weaknesses
    * There will be skills designed around each class
      * Stats could increase effectiveness of skills
    * There will be NPCs
      * The main amount of NPCs will be in the form of 
        hostile enemies that the player must defeat in
        order to progress
      * There will be a friendly NPC that will assist 
        the player at the end of each area excluding
        the final area
     * Menus for the player to use in-game
       * Skills
       * Items
     * Set number of enounters for each area
       * The numbers of encounters and enemies 
         per enounter will be determined beforehand
     * Turn-based combat
     * Stats
       * The stats will affect the character like
         the damage they can deal, damage they can 
         take and tie into other things like skills
       * This will also apply to enemies
     * Traversal/Movement
         

  * Out of Scope  
    * Incorporate sound effects
      * These can be applied to the player or NPCs
    * Incorporate visuals
      * This wouldn't affect the core mechanics of 
        of the game but would be a lot to implement
        a UI for the user to interact with the game
        and for the game itself
    * Encounters
      * If the design reaches a point of completion
        within a reasonable amount of time before 
        deadline then encounters could be changed 
        to have random kind and enemies and possibly
        random number too
