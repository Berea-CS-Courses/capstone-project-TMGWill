*Adding question mark after the specific skill brought up the information for it.*

Reflection
* How was the process of creating your prototype?
  *  The process was interesting. I was able to incorporate feedback from reporting out and was also able to improve it from things that I had put in my data flow diagram.
* How did this process guide, clarify, or inform your design process?
  * It helped me get a better vision for what I would want to create and provided me with a more put together idea to go from.
* What lingering questions do you have regarding modeling or prototyping?
  * I don't have any questions but they were both useful in helping me gain a better idea for how my project could turn out.
* How prepared do you feel to start tackling the implementation of the system you have modeled and prototyped?
  * I feel somewhat more prepared than I did earlier in the design process. I have an idea how it should turn out overall so that should help me with my time trying to implement     it.
