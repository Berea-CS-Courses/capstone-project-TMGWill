1. Pycharm, python (programming language), 
2. An IDE of some kind or a program that would allow you to open and run a python file.
3. This prototype currently allows the player to fight an enemy in a turn-based fashion. The attack and defend options work as I imagined for their design. The skills also work but currently do not have a cooldown for this prototype or provide info on a certain skill. The item option also does not have full functinality but can be accessed as an option.
4. Within the current prototype there is no outside code but later iterations will rely on at least one outside source for code and its use. One of them being adventurelib.
