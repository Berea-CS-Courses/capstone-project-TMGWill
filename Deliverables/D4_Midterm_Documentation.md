# Proof of Concept
![POC1](/Deliverables/POC1.JPG)
The player gets an idea about how much potential damage they can deal with "attack?". The player's turn has not ended yet since they have not done their action.
\
![POC2](/Deliverables/POC2.JPG)
The player chooses to attack using "attack" which ends their turn making it the enemy's turn. The enemy decides to attack which then ends thier turn and goes back to the player.
\
![POC3](/Deliverables/POC3.JPG)
The player has a typo and brings the menu up for them again. The player then chooses the skill option but changes their mind.
\
![POC4](/Deliverables/POC4.JPG)
The player defends receiving reduced damaged from the enemy attack.
\
![POC5](/Deliverables/POC5.JPG)
The player chooses the item option but has no items so they go back to main options and chooses the skills option. They then use a skill which defeats the enemy and the player is the winner.
# Concept Documentation
1. Pycharm, python (programming language), 
2. An IDE of some kind or a program that would allow you to open and run a python file.
3. This prototype currently allows the player to fight an enemy in a turn-based fashion. The attack and defend options work as I imagined for their design. The skills also work but currently do not have a cooldown for this prototype or provide info on a certain skill. The item option also does not have full functinality but can be accessed as an option.
4. Within the current prototype there is no outside code but later iterations will rely on at least one outside source for code and its use. One of them being adventurelib.
