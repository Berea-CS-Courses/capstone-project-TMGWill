# Alpha Testing
## Rooms
* Prevent Early Event Access
  * Out of the three room types that I have within my game which are empty, combat and event, the event room type is the most complicated. One bug that I had earlier on in my        project when first trying to implement how I would have the event rooms function was that the player could activate them earlier than when it should be possible. Event rooms      function through the use of listeners waiting for specific strings, and if the word for that listener was typed in then they could activate them sooner than they should.          However, the player would need to have prior knowledge of what the words are for the listeners before having the ability to activate them. In order to correct I made my program    check if the player is in the right room and if the room is an event room.
