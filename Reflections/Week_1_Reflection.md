**Will Pratt**
1. What have you accomplished this week? (Please list each accomplishment, and explain)
* I have managed to translate my proof of concept to classes I created myself for more of an object oriented programming approach. I have also begun implementing the rooms class from adventurelib within my project.
2. What challenges or difficulties did you face? If you solved them, how? If not, what have you learned so far? Have you sought help or other resources?
* The main challenge that I had was trying to create classes that would work for what I was trying to do and trying to decide what the best route would be. I referenced a previous project of mine where I made my own class to help remind myself of what I can do. It also involved a good deal of trial and error to see what seemed right and what didn't.
3. What do you plan to accomplish in the following week? (Please list at least 3 concrete "S.M.A.R.T." goals, along with estimated number of hours to complete, or day to complete)
* I will work on refining the combat mechanics for the player which could take 1-2 days. I will work on debugging the possible inputs the player could put in when moving between different rooms which could take 1-2 days. I will also work on trying to make rooms more specific so I can use them with a more object oriented kind of appraoach which might take 1-3 days.
4. What resources will you use to accomplish your goals for the upcoming week? (please list out the resources)
* The one resource that comes to mind that I'll be using is adventurelib.
