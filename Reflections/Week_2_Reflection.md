1. What have you accomplished this week? (Please list each accomplishment, and explain)
* I have begun adding comments and have gone about creating states for rooms and checking them to determine what should be done depending on the room.
2. What challenges or difficulties did you face? If you solved them, how? If not, what have you learned so far? Have you sought help or other resources?
* The challenge that I had was trying to come up with more proper and reasonable logic for the room states. I brought up the issue with my pod which was initially debugging but led to them pointing me in a direction to create my room states.
3. What do you plan to accomplish in the following week? (Please list at least 3 concrete "S.M.A.R.T." goals, along with estimated number of hours to complete, or day to complete)
* I did not accomplish all my goals from last week. So I will work on refining the combat mechanics for the player which could take 1-2 days. I will work on debugging the possible inputs the player could put in when moving between different rooms which could take 1-2 days. I will also work on the more introduction kind of things like the title screen and character selection and things along those lines which could take 1-3 days.
4. What resources will you use to accomplish your goals for the upcoming week? (please list out the resources)
* One resource that I'll probably use is youtube for potentially useful script that I could use or a reference for how I could think about writing it.
