**Will Pratt**
1. What have you accomplished this week? (Please list each accomplishment, and explain)
* When traveling between rooms I have have addressed most bugs that could come from incorrect user input. I have added a way that healing items can be used and worked on the logic for enemy skills so that they have cooldowns as well. I also created a story class that will handle the intro and story elements like outputting the title and class selection.
2. What challenges or difficulties did you face? If you solved them, how? If not, what have you learned so far? Have you sought help or other resources?
*  I don't think I had too much trouble but I did notice areas where I could try to write my code more efficiently and where I could turn lines of code into functions.
3. What do you plan to accomplish in the following week? (Please list at least 3 concrete "S.M.A.R.T." goals, along with estimated number of hours to complete, or day to complete)
* I want to create a graph that will be a visual layout for my rooms which could take 1-2 days. I want to add detail and adjust the flow of combat so it's not as bland and feels smoother which could take 1-3 days. I also want to continue working on my story class which could take 1-3 days.
4. What resources will you use to accomplish your goals for the upcoming week? (please list out the resources)
* I will probably use draw.io to make my graph.
