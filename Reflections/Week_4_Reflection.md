1. What have you accomplished this week? (Please list each accomplishment, and explain)
* I have drafted a new intro for my story. Using draw.io I have made a map that will show the layout for my rooms. During combat I added and revised the text to 
  make it more interesting. I also incorporated the time library to give combat more a flow so everything doesn't happen at once and was another factor that was 
  to make combat feel more interesting.
2. What challenges or difficulties did you face? If you solved them, how? If not, what have you learned so far? Have you sought help or other resources?
*  The main challenge that I had was time management and balancing my workload. I'm going to try and find a balance of how and when I should try to focus my attention
   on work between my classes.
3. What do you plan to accomplish in the following week? (Please list at least 3 concrete "S.M.A.R.T." goals, along with estimated number of hours to complete, or day to complete)
* I want add more rooms which could take 1-2 days. I want to add more enemies which could take 1-2 days. I think I want to refactor my character and fight class so 
  writing code for it should be more efficient for me moving on which could take 1-3 days.
4. What resources will you use to accomplish your goals for the upcoming week? (please list out the resources)
* I will be using draw.io to update the map of my rooms.
