2. What challenges or difficulties did you face? If you solved them, how? If not, what have you learned so far? Have you sought help or other resources?
*  I think the challenge I faced was not properly pacing myself but moving forward I will try to tackle my goals in more managable chunks.
3. What do you plan to accomplish in the following week? (Please list at least 3 concrete "S.M.A.R.T." goals, along with estimated number of hours to complete, or day to complete)
* I'm going to create the fights for the new enemies which could take 1-3 days. Create the room descriptions and fully make them to be combat, event, or empty which could take 1-3 days. Add to Story class with epilogue and final_dialogue (to be renamed something else) which could take 1-2 days.
4. What resources will you use to accomplish your goals for the upcoming week? (please list out the resources)
* I will probably use dndbeyond and the monsters as reference for thinking about how I might want to craft my enemies.
