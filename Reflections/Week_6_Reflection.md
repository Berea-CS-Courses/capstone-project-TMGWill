1. What have you accomplished this week? (Please list each accomplishment, and explain)
*  I am in the process of alpha testing. I have created the fight functions for all the enemies. I have added room descriptions and set the states for
   the rooms. I have added text to the final_dialogue function in the Story class. 
2. What challenges or difficulties did you face? If you solved them, how? If not, what have you learned so far? Have you sought help or other resources?
*  I did not really have difficulties. I feel like I was able to tackcle my tasks better and finding out tricks and shortcuts that can help and have helped me when writing code.
3. What do you plan to accomplish in the following week? (Please list at least 3 concrete "S.M.A.R.T." goals, along with estimated number of hours to complete, or day to complete)
* I will finish alpha testing which will take 1-2 days. I will get the game in a state for ad hoc testing which will take 1-3 days. I will conduct an ad hoc test which will take 1-2 days. I will add an epilogue to the Story class which will take 1 day.
4. What resources will you use to accomplish your goals for the upcoming week? (please list out the resources)
* I will probably have the assistance of someone I know locally for my ad hoc testing.
